This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This appears to be a new or empty repository with minimal structure. The repository currently contains only Claude Code configuration files.

## Current Structure

- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Claude Code local settings with permission configuration

## Development Environment

This repository is currently empty and does not contain any source code, build configurations, or development tooling. Future development work will need to establish:

- Project type and language selection
- Build system and dependency management
- Testing framework
- Code quality tools (linting, formatting)

## Next Steps

When beginning development in this repository, consider:

1. Initialize the project with appropriate language-specific tooling
2. Set up build and test commands
3. Configure development dependencies
4. Establish code structure and architecture patterns

This CLAUDE.md file should be updated as the project structure evolves to include specific build commands, architectural decisions, and development workflows.
